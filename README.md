# bert-punctuation-restoration

This project mainly based on the paper [1], trying to reproduce some of the results on TED Talks dataset. Some ideas also were taken from [2].

## Try it yourself

Use this

to run the sample notebook which demonstrates restoration.

## Usage

### Environment setup
Tested on Python 3.9.12.

Install required packages using Pip.\
`pip install -r reqiurements.txt`

Configure Python interpreter path with the following line.\
`export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:./src"`

### Downloads
Download data using the script.\
`python ./src/data_utils/download_data.py`

### Training
Run training.\
`python ./src/train/run_training.py <model_name> <max_epochs>`

### Evaluation
Evaluate trained model. Model checkpoint should be placed in `./models`.\
`python ./src/train/measure_quality.py <model_name>`

### Trained models
If needed, download trained models and place it into `./models`\
